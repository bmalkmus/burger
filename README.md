burger eating app
## Description
Here is a creation of an interactive burger devouring application that is deployed to Heroku. In the app, you simply enter a burger name and it will appear in the devour side of the screen with a button beside the burger to eat. Once clicked, the burger will move to the right side of the window with the button disappearing. The main focus of this project was working with handlebars and the Model View Controller architectural pattern.
